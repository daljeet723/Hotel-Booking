                    DIFFERENCE B/W req.params and req.id

req.params:
req.params is used to extract values from the route parameters in the URL.
For example, in the route definition /users/:id, if a request is made to /users/123, then req.params.id will be 123.
It is useful for extracting dynamic values from the path of the URL.

req.query:
req.query is used to extract values from the query parameters in the URL.
Query parameters are typically appended to the URL using the ? character followed by key-value pairs separated by &.
For example, in the URL /users?id=123, req.query.id will be 123.
It is useful for handling optional parameters or parameters that don't necessarily need to be part of the path.
